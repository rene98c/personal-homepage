      "paragraph1": "I'm a quiet architect — a developer who spent years behind the scenes, crafting clean code while the spotlight favored noise.",
      "paragraph2": "After stepping away into the crypto world — where I found both financial freedom and perspective — I came back to coding with a new tool at my side: AI.",
      "paragraph3": "In my first weeks back, I built a mission-critical access control system in 15 days, a multilingual portfolio site in 2, and a full MEWS → Directo integration in 6 hours.",
      "paragraph4": "Not because I rushed — but because I finally let go of the drag.",
      "paragraph5": "I work fast, but I think deeply. I let AI handle the boilerplate — I focus on architecture and clarity.",
      "paragraph6": "I'm not chasing a title. I'm building with intent.",
      "paragraph7": "I'm here to solve problems that matter."
