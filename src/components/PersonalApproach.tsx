              While technical skills are essential, I believe that exceptional coding ability is at the core of truly impactful software development. 
              I express myself most fluently through code, where I often enter a flow state that allows me to create elegant solutions to complex problems. 
              Coding is an art form to me - I lose track of time when I&apos;m in the zone, fully immersed in crafting clean, efficient solutions.

              While I may find verbal communication challenging at times, I excel at expressing complex technical concepts in written form. 
              I leverage various tools, including AI, to articulate my ideas clearly and effectively when collaborating with others.

              I&apos;m based in a beautiful rural area near the city of Tartu, Estonia. This location offers
              me the perfect balance between focused work environment and access to a vibrant tech community
              when needed.

              Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about software architecture, and 
              continuously enhancing my skills to stay at the forefront of the industry. While I&apos;m currently engaged
              in a professional role, I&apos;m always open to discussing interesting projects and opportunities.
